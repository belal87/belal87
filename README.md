# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Belal Hossain
## Web Developer

I am a web developer with 5 years of experience. Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications. It involves designing, coding, and building the various elements that make up a website, including its layout, functionality, and interactivity. Web developers use programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript also react-JS, and next-JS to create the front-end (client-side) components that users interact with. They also utilize server-side languages like PHP, Python, and node-JS to handle back-end processes and database management such as MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc. Web development encompasses a wide range of skills and technologies, including responsive design, content management systems (CMS), e-commerce platforms, and web security.
